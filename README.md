# HCI Research Project: Interpretation of Activation Maps in Generative Modelling
Welcome to the HCI Research Project repository focused on the interpretation of activation maps in generative modeling. This project explores the implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) along with various loss functions including style loss, entropy, and their application in face editing using facial masks.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this research project is to delve into the interpretability of activation maps generated during the training and inference phases of generative models, particularly CGANs. By studying activation maps, we aim to gain insights into how different regions of the input space contribute to the generation process, thus enhancing our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of generative modeling.

### Key Features
CGAN Implementation: The repository includes the implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. CGANs enable conditional generation, allowing us to control the characteristics of the generated outputs based on given conditions.

### Loss Functions:
I experiment with various loss functions including style loss and entropy to enhance the performance and convergence of the CGAN model. These loss functions play a crucial role in guiding the learning process and improving the quality of generated samples.

### Face Editing with Facial Mask:
One of the applications of our research is in face editing using facial masks. By leveraging the interpretability of activation maps, we aim to develop techniques for selective editing of facial features while preserving the overall image quality and realism.
